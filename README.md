# Firebase Offline Data Handling and Error Management

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase: handling offline situations and errors during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where data is attempted to be written to the database without checking connectivity. This can lead to silent failures.  `bugSolution.js` provides a solution demonstrating how to gracefully handle offline conditions and errors, improving the user experience.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary credentials in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`.
3.  Run `bug.js`. Observe that there's no clear indication of failure when offline.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js`. Observe the more robust error handling and offline behavior.
